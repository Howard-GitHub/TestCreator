# Test-Creator

## This is a web application that allows the user to create problem sets, each problem set with its own prompt and answer, and to create an assessment using the problem sets. 

The test creator application gives the user the option to create sections in the general dashboard. Within each section, the user can give the section a title and create problem sets where each problem set will have a prompt input area and answer input area for the user to type in. Any changes made in the general dashboard will be saved, meaning refreshing the screen or re-opening the application will not remove prior modifications. A section must have at least 6 problem sets with each prompt input area and answer input area containing typed input in order for the user to create an assessment using the problem sets in that section. In the assessment, the user will encounter problems that can either be in multiple choice or input area typed format.
